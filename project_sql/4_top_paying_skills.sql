Key insights: 

Big data and cloud-native tools dominate top-paying roles, with technologies like PySpark, Databricks, Airflow, and GCP appearing frequently among the highest-paying skills.

Machine learning and automation platforms such as DataRobot, Watson, and scikit-learn are strongly represented, indicating that data analysts with ML skills command higher salaries.

DevOps and engineering tools including GitLab, Bitbucket, Jenkins, and Linux are common, showing that data analysts with engineering and deployment capabilities are valued more.

The Python data stack (pandas, numpy, Jupyter) consistently appears across high-paying roles, confirming that advanced programming and data manipulation skills are essential for top-tier analyst positions.
